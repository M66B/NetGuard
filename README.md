# NetGuard

*NetGuard* provides simple and advanced ways to block access to the internet - no root required.
Applications and addresses can individually be allowed or denied access to your Wi-Fi and/or mobile connection.

Blocking access to the internet can help:

* reduce your data usage
* save your battery
* increase your privacy

NetGuard is the first free and open source no-root firewall for Android.

* Optionally record network usage per application per address
* Optionally [block ads using a hosts file](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md) (not available if installed from the Play store)
* Material design theme with light and dark theme

PRO features:

* Log all outgoing traffic; search and filter access attempts; export PCAP files to analyze traffic
* Allow/block individual addresses per application
* New application notifications; configure NetGuard directly from the notification
* Display network speed graph in a status bar notification

There is no other no-root firewall offering all these features.

Usage:

* Enable the firewall using the switch in the action bar
* Allow/deny Wi-Fi/mobile internet access using the icons along the right side of the application list

You can use the settings menu to change from blacklist mode (allow all in *Settings* but block unwanted applications in list) to whitelist mode (block all in *Settings* but allow favorite applications in list).

* Red/orange/yellow/amber = internet access denied
* Teal/blue/purple/grey = internet access allowed

Compatibility
-------------

The only way to build a no-root firewall on Android is to use the Android VPN service.
Android doesn't allow chaining of VPN services, so you cannot use NetGuard together with other VPN based applications.
See also [this FAQ](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/FAQ.md#FAQ2).

NetGuard can be used on rooted devices too and even offers more features than most root firewalls.

Some Android versions, expecially not updated Samsung Android versions, have a buggy VPN implementation,
which results in Android refusing to start the VPN service in certain circumstances,
like when there is no internet conncectivity yet (when starting up your device)
or when incorrectly requiring manual approval of the VPN service again (when starting up your device).
Unfortunately these Android bugs cannot be worked around by NetGuard.

Filtering mode cannot be used on [CopperheadOS](https://copperhead.co/android/).

NetGuard will not work or crash when the package *com.android.vpndialogs* has been removed or otherwise is unavailable.
Removing this package is possible with root permissions only.

NetGuard is supported for phones and tablets only, so not for other device types like on a television or in a car.

Wi-Fi or IP calling will not work if your provider uses [IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) to encrypt your phone calls, SMS messages and/or MMS messages,
unless there was made an exception in NetGuard for your provider (currently for T-Mobile and Verizon).
I am happy to add exceptions for other providers, but I need the [MCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code) codes, [MNC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNC) codes and [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) ranges your provider is using.
As an alternative you can enable the option '*Disable on call*', which is available since version 2.113.

*Building*

Building is simple, if you install the right tools:

* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/)
* [Android NDK](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/)

The native code is built as part of the Android Studio project.

It is expected that you can solve build problems yourself, so there is no support on building.
If you cannot build yourself, there are prebuilt versions of NetGuard available [here](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/releases).

*Translating*

* Translations to other languages are welcomed
* You can translate online [here](https://crowdin.com/project/netguard/)
* If your language is not listed, please send a message to marcel(plus)netguard(at)faircode(dot)eu
* You can see the status of all translations [here](https://crowdin.com/project/netguard).
