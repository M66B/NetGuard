# NetGuard

*NetGuard* provides a simple way to block access to the internet - no root required.
Applications can individually be allowed or denied access to your Wi-Fi and/or mobile connection.

Blocking access to the internet can help:

* reduce your data usage
* save your battery
* increase your privacy

NetGuard is the first free and open source no-root firewall for Android.

It works in Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and later.

Features:

* No root required
* Simple to use
* Free of charge
* Open source
* No extra battery usage
* No bandwidth reduction
* No calling home
* No tracking or analytics
* No ads
* No internet permission required
* IPv4/IPv6 TCP/UDP supported
* Optionally allow when screen on
* Optionally block when roaming
* Optionally block system applications
* Graphical network speed display
* Material design

There is no other no-root firewall offering all these features.
Most other firewall solutions will use extra battery and reduce the overall network speed.

Most of these features are the result of sending selected traffic to a sinkhole, instead of filtering all internet traffic.
This means that advanced features, like address based filtering (needed for ad blocking), traffic logging, and on-demand configuration, are not possible.
Routing selected traffic into a sinkhole relies on an API introduced in Android 5.0 (Lollipop),
therefore older Android versions unfortunately cannot be supported.

Since NetGuard has no internet permission, you know it is not spying on you.

Requirements:

* Android 5.0 or later
* A [compatible device](#Compatibility)

NetGuard will crash when the package *com.android.vpndialogs* has been removed or otherwise is unavailable.

Wi-Fi/USB tethering and Wi-Fi will not work when NetGuard is enabled due to a bug in Android ([issue](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/issues/42)).

Unfortunately it is not possible to workaround any of these Android problems.
