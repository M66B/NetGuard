NetGuard


Short description
-----------------
NetGuard, the first open source no-root firewall for Android


Long description
----------------
NetGuard is a simple way to block access to the internet - no root required.

Applications can individually be allowed or denied access to your WiFi and/or mobile connection.

Blocking access to the internet can help:

- reduce your data usage
- save your battery
- increase your privacy

NetGuard is possibly the first free and open source no-root firewall for Android.

Features:

- No root required
- Simple to use
- Free of charge
- Open source
- No extra battery usage
- No bandwidth reduction
- No calling home
- No tracking or analytics
- No ads
- No internet permission required
- IPv4/IPv6 TCP/UDP supported
- Block system and user applications
- Material design

Most of these features are the result of sending selected traffic to a VPN sinkhole, instead of filtering all internet traffic.
This means that advanced features, like address-based filtering (needed for hosts blocking), traffic logging, and on-demand configuration, are not possible.
