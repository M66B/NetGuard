  <string name="app_first">Great care has been taken to develop and test NetGuard,
however it is impossible to guarantee it will work correctly on every device.
NetGuard is known to crash when activated on some devices. It is also known to block all traffic on some other devices.
These issues are caused by bugs in Android, or in the software provided by the manufacturer, so please don\'t blame NetGuard.
